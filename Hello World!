Total newbie here, I know ZERO about coding.  I want to learn at least the basics because I think it'll be a very good thing to know.. Make me more valuable on the job market.  Plus, I think it sounds like a skill that one use to earn a living from home, which is really very appealing to me.  Thanks for listening, and I hope to be able to become a useful member of the group!
